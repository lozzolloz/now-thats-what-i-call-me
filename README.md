*Though this app is now live, it is currently in Spotify's developer mode, which means only users I have added via the name and email address on their Spotify account can use it.*
*My extension request to make it publically available is currently under review by Spotify.*

THATSWHATIFY uses an authentication server to allow users to log in with Spotify and grant the app permission to see their top tracks. 

Users can then select various track limits, time periods and design themes to create their own compilation CD back cover which lists their most streamed tracks.

This image can then be saved for sharing and debate on social media. 

This monorepo is split into two folders, the auth server built using node and express, and the client-side frontend built using React and CSS.

THATSWHATIFY IS NOW LIVE! https://thatswhatify.netlify.app/

THATSWHATIFY uses an authentication server to allow users to log in with Spotify and grant the app permission to see their top tracks. 

Users can then select various track limits, time periods and design themes to create their own compilation CD back cover which lists their most streamed tracks.

The display name on the user's Spotify account is also pulled to create the title of the CD.

This image can then be saved for sharing and debate on social media. 

This monorepo is split into two folders, the auth server built using node and express, and the client-side frontend built using React and CSS.
